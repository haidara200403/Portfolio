		<p>Artificial intelligence, or AI, has been around for decades, but it is only in recent years that it has started to gain mainstream attention. From Siri to self-driving cars, AI is becoming more and more prevalent in our daily lives.</p>

		<p>AI refers to the development of computer systems that can perform tasks that would normally require human intelligence, such as learning, problem solving, and decision making. Machine learning is a subset of AI that involves training algorithms to make decisions based on data inputs.</p>

		<p>AI is already having a significant impact on industries such as healthcare, finance, and manufacturing. In healthcare, AI is being used to analyze medical images and help doctors diagnose diseases more accurately. In finance, AI is being used to detect fraud and make investment decisions. And in manufacturing, AI is being used to optimize production processes and improve quality control.</p>

		<p>However, as AI becomes more advanced and ubiquitous, there are concerns about its impact on society. One of the main concerns is the potential for AI to displace human workers, leading to job losses and economic inequality. There are also concerns about the ethical implications of AI, such as biases in algorithms and the use of AI in surveillance.</p>
		<p>As AI continues to evolve and become more integrated into our lives, it is important to carefully consider its benefits and risks. By working to address these concerns, we can ensure that AI is used in ways that benefit society as a whole.</p>
